### ERP-Fullstack Deverloper

I began coding with MASM (an assembly language) at 10 years old. Then delved into C, C++. So, I go with the foundation and optimization mindset. Based on that, I have learned and used higher level programming languages:

- **MASM** (for RCA, application analysing)
- **C/C++** (build application, tools, solving LeetCode algorithm problems)
- **Javascript** (or Nodejs) (both web and application)
- **Python** (Data science, Django, Odoo, academic research)
- **VBA** (especially VBA for Excel)
- **PHP** (vBulletin, Wordpress, Symfony)
- **Java** (especially tools for processing PDFs)
- **R** (processing data, academic research)
- ...


I have leaded a small team, specializing in building business-ERP websites and optimizing systems, build solution for the spec√¨ic problems.
